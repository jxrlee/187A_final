              <h2>The Amateur (Beginner)</h2>
              <h4>User Description</h4>
              <p>This user has little to no understanding or previous experience listening 
                to Electronic Dance Music. If asked what EDM stands for, these users probably 
                wouldn’t be able to tell you. These users may have listened to a few seconds 
                of electronic dance music on late night radio without knowing but end up 
                switching stations due to their lack of knowledge. They cannot recognize genres 
                of EDM and classify everything as ‘techno’.</p>
              <h4>Research</h4>
              <p>We expected our amateur users to not know any EDM forums or websites because they are not particularly interested in this genre.  As a result, we expected this user group to provide us with the least amount of useful information to incorporate into our website.
                <br />
                After interviewing several people who considered themselves as amateurs with EDM, it was surprising to see what they thought of the music.  One amateur has a very general view that this type of music is created with mixing boards, but expressed nothing about the music itself.  This comes to no surprise because this person’s favorite genre is Jazz.  As expected, the information they provided us with was very minimal because they did not have a solid understanding of the genre itself.
              </p>
              <h4>Importance</h4>
              <p>Due to the lack of information this user group provided, it’s really tough to figure out the content to include on our site.  Instead, we can take this user group as a lack of exposure and knowledge.  We can include a general information page that describes the different kinds of EDM to educate this user group.</p>
              <h4>User Scenarios</h4>
              <p>1. My amateur listeners will want to know what EDM is.</p>
              <p>2. My amateur listeners will want to know the difference between the different genres.</p>
              <p>3. My amateur listeners will want to know a few mainstream songs.</p>
              <p>4. My amateur listeners will want to know a few mainstream artists.</p>
              <p>5. My amateur listeners will want to know EDM culture.</p>

              <a name="casual"></a>
              <h2>The Casual Listener (Intermediate)</h2>
              <h4>User Description</h4>
              <p>This user listens to electronic dance music occasionally. They 
                can recognize and enjoy mainstream EDM songs but are mostly limited 
                to what is played on the radio. These casual listeners know what EDM 
                stands for and can even recognize a few of the main genres but not 
                the subgenres. Casual listeners will also have interest in going to 
                see artists and DJs in the future or have already seen them at least once.</p>
              <h4>Research</h4>
              <p>We expected this user group to be knowledgeable about EDM and the scene.  We expect them to know some mainstream songs, know the terminology, and occasionally visit EDM sites to find songs or see what’s happening in the community.  These users will be more inclined to download songs rather than read the news. 
                <br />
                This user group did in fact download a lot more than the amateur users.  They did not have any particular sites in mind, but did simple Google queries to find what they want.  They have a general idea of what EDM is and listen to “mainstream” songs that play on the radio.  This user group is satisfied with the information that they see on the sites.  We mainly think they are satisfied because they aren’t searching for content or information, but the song itself.  As long as there is a download link, they will be on the site.
              </p>
              <h4>Importance</h4>
              <p>Based off the information that this user group has provided us, it is essential to have some download links to live sets or individual songs.  This user group seems to navigate to sites for the sole purpose of downloading songs.  Since we want all our users to be knowledgeable, we can provide more information about the song that they are downloading instead of simply putting a download link.</p>
              <h4>User Scenarios</h4>
              <p>1. My intermediate listeners will want to learn about different EDM subgenres.</p>
              <p>2. My intermediate listeners will want to discover new artists.</p>
              <p>3. My intermediate listeners will want to discover new songs.</p>
              <p>4. My intermediate listeners will want to attend big events.</p>
              <p>5. My intermediate listeners will want to connect with the community.</p>

              <a name="edmhead"></a>
              <h2>The EDMhead (Advanced)</h2>
              <h4>User Description</h4>
              <p>This user is obsessed with EDM. EDMheads are extremely knowledgeable 
                about the music and can recognize and distinguish between genres and 
                subgenres. They are always on the lookout for newly released songs, up 
                and coming artists, and future events. Most of these users have also 
                been to see more than a few artists and DJs.</p>
              <h4>Research</h4>
              <p>We expect this user group to be very knowledgeable about EDM and regularly visit forums and other EDM sites.  They would probably prefer to see less advertisements and more about upcoming events in their areas with audio streaming capabilities (in addition to downloads).  This user group should also have favorite genres as well as artists (some that are lesser known).
                <br />
                As expected, this user group had a strong list of sites that they regularly visited.  They primarily wanted to see less of advertisements and more of upcoming events in their areas along with full live sets for download.  One user also noted having a larger community page.  Overall, these users wanted more tangible content related to their interests as well as accessibility to music.
              </p>
              <h4>Importance</h4>
              <p>Based off the information that this user group has provided us, it is important to create a sense of community within the site (perhaps a forum or collaboration area) with audio streaming capabilities and a download link.  In addition, there needs to be a small number (if any) of advertisements.</p>
              <h4>User Scenarios</h4>
              <p>1. My advanced users will want to know what new songs have been released.</p>
              <p>2. My advanced users will want to download DJ podcasts.</p>
              <p>3. My advanced users will want to view event and podcast tracklistings.</p>
              <p>4. My advanced users will want to know what events are coming up in the future.</p>
              <p>5. My advanced users will want to purchase event tickets.</p>
